            <p>
                I started my programming journey with curiosity about how websites worked and quickly fell in love with frontend development.
                I enjoy building sleek, interactive interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing.
                Outside of coding, I love painting and exploring new hiking trails.
            </p>
